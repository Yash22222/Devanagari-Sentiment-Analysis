1] Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi and Gujarati CSV Files:-
The datasets used in the "Devanagari Sentiment Analysis" project are collections of text data written in four languages: Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, and Gujarati. 
Each dataset includes text samples along with corresponding sentiment labels, which categorize the sentiment expressed in the text as positive, negative, or neutral. 
These datasets are carefully prepared and annotated to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models for sentiment analysis tasks in languages using the Devanagari script. 
By leveraging these datasets, the project aims to develop accurate sentiment analysis models tailored to these languages, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis of social media content, customer reviews, 
and news articles in the Devanagari script-based languages.


2] Hindi, Marathi Punjabi and Gujarati TFF Datasets:-
The TFF (True Fake Fact) dataset used in the "Devanagari Sentiment Analysis" project consists of text samples in Devanagari script, labeled with one of three categories: True, Fake, or Fact. 
This dataset is designed for training and evaluating machine learning models to classify text based on its authenticity or truthfulness. 
The TFF dataset provides a valuable resource for developing algorithms to detect misinformation, fake news, or false claims in texts written in languages using the Devanagari script. 
Through the analysis of this dataset, the project aims to contribute to the development of robust models for identifying and combating misinformation in Devanagari-script languages.
