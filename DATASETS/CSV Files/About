The datasets used in the "Devanagari Sentiment Analysis" project are collections of text data written in four languages: Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, and Gujarati. 
Each dataset includes text samples along with corresponding sentiment labels, which categorize the sentiment expressed in the text as positive, negative, or neutral. 
These datasets are carefully prepared and annotated to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models for sentiment analysis tasks in languages using the Devanagari script. 
By leveraging these datasets, the project aims to develop accurate sentiment analysis models tailored to these languages, enabling applications such as sentiment analysis of social media content, customer reviews, 
and news articles in the Devanagari script-based languages.
